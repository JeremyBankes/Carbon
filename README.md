# Setup

Although the client application is written in Java and platform independent, this release comes with supporting files to make for easy installation on Windows.

## Step 1 - Extract Contents
To install, simply download and extract the contents of **Carbon Client.zip** (Right-click *Extract all...* or use other extraction software such as 7Zip or WinRar) to a *permanent* location. **C:\Program Files** would be a good choice.

*Note:* It it suggested to use a permanent location as the client will use this location for scheduling automatic starting)

## Step 2 - Run Shortcut
Once the files are extracted. Enter the directory, and run the **Carbon (Windows)** shortcut.

*Note:* This shortcut enforces that the client is run with administrative privileges (This is required to allow for windows task scheduling). If you run the program without administrator privileges, you will receive error messages when trying to alter the **Start Carbon automatically with system** setting.

After a moment, you should see a Carbon Icon appear on your system tray. Congratulations! You're running the Carbon Client.

## Step 3 - Alter Settings
You can now click on this icon and select the **Settings** option. This will bright up the Carbon Settings configuration dialog. A more in depth explanation of each of these options is coming in the future!

*Note:* If you leave **Start Carbon automatically with system** checked, you will never have to run Carbon manually again! This is recommended, however you can always create another shortcut of **Carbon (Windows)** and place it wherever you'd like if you'd still like the option of starting Carbon by yourself.

The images used in this overview were created using the client, and are being served by the server application!
